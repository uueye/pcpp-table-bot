I noticed you linked at least one identifiable PC Part Picker URL in your post, 
e.g. https://pcpartpicker.com/user/pcpp-helper-bot/saved/abc123. 
Next time you can just post an anonymous list URL, e.g. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/abc123 with an accompanying table.

&nbsp;

[PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) will create the table for you if you click on the Reddit logo at the top of your list.
When posting, click the **Markdown Mode** button in the top right of the text input window and paste
the list into it.
